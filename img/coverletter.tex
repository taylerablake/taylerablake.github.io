I am excited to apply for the Senior Data Scientist position at PAI. With over a decade of applied data science experience across diverse industries and an extensive academic background in Statistics including a Ph.D. from The Ohio State University, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and a commitment to work that serves a greater purpose.

Throughout my career, I have harnessed the power of data to solve complex challenges, leveraging machine learning for public and private sector advancements. During my time at Immuta and Ketch, I spearheaded research and development in statistical privacy and security. Leveraging my skills to contribute to a product designed to protect and empower consumers was particularly gratifying to me. These experiences align seamlessly with PAIâ€™s mission to advocate for accessible, quality healthcare and advance the sexual and reproductive rights of women, girls, and marginalized groups.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to apply my skills toward an organization dedicated to meaningful impact. My professional journey has been fueled by a desire to improve lives, and I believe data science can be a powerful tool for achieving fairness, equity and accessibility. Joining PAI would allow me to merge my technical proficiency with my passion for driving social change, ensuring that data-driven insights amplify the voices of those who need it most. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my expertise and dedication to PAI's team. I have attached my resume for your review and look forward to discussing how my skills and experiences can contribute to PAI's important mission. Thank you for considering my application.

For a set $S$ to be polygonizable, the sum of the lengths of any subset of elements in $S$ must be greater than the length of the remaining elements. In other words, if $S = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$, then for any subset $T \subset S$, we must have $\sum_{a_i \in T} a_i > \sum_{a_j \notin T} a_j$. This condition ensures that the elements in $S$ can form a polygon.
