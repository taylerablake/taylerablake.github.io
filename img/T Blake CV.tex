\section{Experience}

\subsection{Data Scientist}
\cventry{}{Root Insurance}{Columbus, OH}{}{}{}
\cvline{April 2019-present}{Data scientist supporting teams responsible for customer acquisition and development of pricing plans. Designs and analyzes A/B tests and  develops conversion and retention models. Such models serve to forecast the impact of changes in pricing methodologies on KPIs which measure the fundamental health of the business, including loss ratio and total bound premium. Integrates with product teams and actuaries at every stage of the data science life cycle, from problem formulation and data collection to model deployment and communication of insights generated from analysis.}


\subsection{Senior Data Scientist}
\cventry{}{Information Control Company}{Columbus, OH}{}{}{}
\cvline{January 2017-present}{Consultant serving as a senior data scientist, leading data science team members alongside delivery team members and data engineers. Responsible for planning, designing, and executing analytical plans to address business questions for a variety of clients across several business verticals. }

\cvline{}{Internally at ICC, contributes to Advanced Analytics development seminars and heads the Advanced Analytics journal club, curating current literature in statistics, data science, and machine learning and leading discussions about the content and possible application to ICC client problems.}

\subsection{Machine Learning Specialist}
\cventry{}{Pillar Technology}{Columbus, OH}{}{}{}
\cvline{February 2016-December 2016}{Machine learning specialist on a team responsible for designing and developing adaptive software for an IoT product to be embedded in a line of luxury
vehicles. Responsible for setting expectations given the available resources such as data, available in-device storage space, and computational constraints with both internal team and with
the client.}

\cvline{}{Challenged to design and implement predictive algorithms in the absence of data a priori. Had to outline the risk presented by an imbalance between bias and stability of statistical estimates and predictions, particularly with respect to the impact on user experience. Used techniques for automatic variable and model selection to ensure that algorithms adapted appropriately over time and with additional training data. Followed work from end to end, from writing exploratory analysis to production-level implementation alongside developers using Agile best practices. Implemented methodologies in Scala and Java with a strong emphasis on test-driven development.}

\cvline{}{Spearheaded components of project planning pertaining to data and the corresponding infrastructure necessary for data collection, storage, and modeling at scale. Lead efforts to establish client trust in data modeling and algorithms, a new operating space for Pillar.}

\subsection{Data Scientist}
\cventry{}{Store Development, Starbucks Coffee Company}{Seattle, WA}{}{}{}
\cvline{May 2014 - November 2015}{Data scientist on a team serving the company in market planning and strategy. Utilized a variety of statistical and machine learning methods, both supervised and unsupervised such as penalized regression and classification, generalized linear models, ensemble methods including boosting, bagging, and random forests, with applications of the latter to both classification and clustering. }
\cvline{}{Estimated causal impact of a variety of interventions, such as competitor store openings, pricing changes, or new product launches on store performance using Bayesian structural time series models and summarizes comparisons between this methodology and prior approaches, including the traditional difference-in-differences estimators. }
\cvline{}{Cleaned and analyzed heterogeneous data from several different sources having both potential spatial and temporal components which pose challenges in aggregation and summarization.}

\cvline{}{Lab instructor for an introductory statistics course, Statistics 145, 245, 133, and 2480.}

\section{Research Interests}
My research interests include nonparametric function estimation, particularly utilizing reproducing kernel Hilbert space methods; my dissertation work focuses on nonparametric estimation of large covariance matrices through the estimation of covariance functions, specifically in the case of irregularly spaced and sparsely sampled data. We propose an estimation framework with unconstrained optimization through a specific decomposition of a covariance matrix. This parameterization renders covariance estimation as the estimation of a varying coefficient regression model, which allows us access to machinery typically used in the classic function estimation setting for estimating a positive definite covariance matrix.
