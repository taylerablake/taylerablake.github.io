\section{Research Interests}
My research interests include nonparametric function estimation, particularly utilizing reproducing kernel Hilbert space methods; my dissertation work focuses on nonparametric estimation of large covariance matrices through the estimation of covariance functions, specifically in the case of irregularly spaced and sparsely sampled data. We propose an estimation framework with unconstrained optimization through a specific decomposition of a covariance matrix. This parameterization renders covariance estimation as the estimation of a varying coefficient regression model, which allows us access to machinery typically used in the classic function estimation setting for estimating a positive definite covariance matrix.
